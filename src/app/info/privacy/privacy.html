    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="privacy-intro">
        <h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>
        <p>We have written this privacy policy (version 15.07.2025-113026084) to explain to you in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and applicable national laws which personal data we process.</p>
        <p>In short: We provide you with comprehensive information about data that we process about you.</p>
        <p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. This privacy policy, on the other hand, is intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. Where it promotes transparency, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly way, links to further information are provided and graphics are used.</p>
